description: "“Ways of Seeing”: Documenting Endangered Afghan Heritage Sites Using Photogrammetry and Mixed Reality"
importance: 3
category: main

For this project, I applied photogrammetry to generate VR “digital twins” of seven heritage sites in Afghanistan, creating VR archives for historical conservation. I also developed an AR-based iOS game for displaced Afghan children to engage with the sites. This work was presented at the MIT Media Lab conference “Ways of Seeing.”
