I conducted camera calibration for Boston Dynamics’ Spot robots and performed baseline tests. I also improved robot arm motion control using inverse kinematics through MR headsets. I presented this work at Leadership Alliance National Conference 2023 and Tanner Conference 2023.</p> <p>Github repo: https://github.com/mlu108/enerf-scene-reconstruction</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_enerf-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_enerf-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_enerf-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_enerf.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </body></html>
