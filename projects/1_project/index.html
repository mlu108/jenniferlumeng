I integrated yolov5 and DeepFace to differentiate parent versus child for accurate attention estimation (95% accuracy) and built pipeline to analyze emotions and nonverbal cues during dyadic interaction. I wrote one first-author paper “EmoLink: Facial and Emotion Perception System for Displaying Interpersonal Dynamics in Real-World Parent-Child Interactions” (submitted to ICMI 2024).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_historical_reconstruction-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_historical_reconstruction-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_historical_reconstruction-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_historical_reconstruction.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </body></html>
