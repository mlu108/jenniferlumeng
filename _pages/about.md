I’m a second-year Sc.M. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/) and [Carsten Eickhoff](https://health-nlp.com/). I earned my B.A. from Wellesley College in 2024. My research focuses on mechanistic interpretability—mapping hidden representations to the functions models learn, uncovering circuits behind model behavior, and exploring connections between large language models and human cognitive and linguistic processes.
